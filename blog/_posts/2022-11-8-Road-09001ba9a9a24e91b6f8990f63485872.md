Tested uploading an image to find upload location, it looks like the profile image path is commented out so picture doesn't update.

Nothing interesting there. Starting a python http server to upload exploits.

I was going to run LinPeas but decided to try PwnKit first. Downloading and executing PwnKit.

An interesting box, I feel I missed something by using PwnKit to get root so easily as I imagine it was made before it was available and they had something else in mind.
